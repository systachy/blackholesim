# BlackHoleSimulator

## Overview
The BlackHoleSimulator is a Python-based visualization tool that simulates the interaction of particles with a black hole using gravitational physics. It leverages the `vpython` library to create a dynamic 3D representation of particles being attracted to and absorbed by a black hole.

## Features
- **3D Simulation:** Real-time simulation of particles influenced by a black hole.
- **Random Initialization:** Particles start with random positions and velocities.
- **Dynamic Absorption:** Particles that get too close to the black hole are absorbed, mimicking the effect of an event horizon.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust parameters like gravitational constant, black hole mass, and initial particle speed to see different behaviors.

## Prerequisites
To run this simulator, you need Python installed along with the `vpython` library. You can install `vpython` with pip:
```bash
pip install vpython
```

## Usage
1. Download and open the `main.py` file in an IDE that supports Python.
2. Run the script directly from the IDE or via the command line:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. Observe the simulation in the newly opened VPython window. Interact with the scene using your mouse to rotate and zoom.
